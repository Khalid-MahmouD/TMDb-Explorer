# Flixx App

Movie info application built with vanilla JavaScript that uses **version 3** of the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)

This is part of my **Modern JS From The Beginning 2.0** course

## Usage

Just clone or download and then register for a free API key at https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api

Once you get your key, just add it to the `api.apiKey` value in the global state at the top.

**Note:** If you are using this as a production project, you should not store this in the client. You can create a proxy server and store your key there. I may add that to the repo later on.

I also may convert this to use a module bundler such as Vite or Webpack.

## Theme (HTML & CSS)

I also included the theme here for you to download. It does not include any JavaScript at all. This is what you should use if you are following along with the course.
